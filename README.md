- Real-time transaction processing
- Regulatory reporting infrastructure
- Customer data platforms
- Risk and fraud detection systems

### Key Objectives

- Establish consistent data engineering standards across all business units

## 2. Data Engineering Principles

### 2.1 Core Principles

#### Principle 1: Data as a Strategic Asset
Data must be treated as a critical organizational asset, with appropriate governance, quality controls, and lifecycle management. Every data engineering decision should consider the long-term value and utility of data across the enterprise.

#### Principle 2: Security and Privacy by Design
All data engineering solutions must implement security controls from inception. This includes encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, data masking for sensitive information, and compliance with banking regulations including PCI-DSS, SOX, and regional privacy laws.

#### Principle 3: Scalability and Elasticity
Systems must be designed to handle exponential growth in data volume, velocity, and variety. Architecture should support both vertical and horizontal scaling, with preference for cloud-native, elastic solutions that can adapt to changing workloads.

#### Principle 4: Data Quality and Integrity
Implement comprehensive data quality frameworks including validation rules, reconciliation processes, and automated quality monitoring. Establish clear data quality metrics and SLAs for critical data domains.

#### Principle 5: Automation First
Prioritize automation in all aspects of data engineering including ingestion, transformation, quality checks, and deployment. Manual processes should be the exception, requiring explicit justification.

#### Principle 6: Self-Service Enablement
Design platforms that enable business users and data scientists to access and analyze data independently while maintaining governance and security controls. Provide intuitive interfaces and comprehensive documentation.

#### Principle 7: Cost Optimization
Continuously monitor and optimize infrastructure costs. Implement tiered storage strategies, data lifecycle management, and resource optimization techniques to balance performance requirements with cost efficiency.

### 2.2 Architectural Principles

#### Loosely Coupled Architecture
Design systems with minimal dependencies between components. Use event-driven architectures and message queues to decouple producers and consumers of data.

#### Idempotency and Reproducibility
All data pipelines must be idempotent - producing the same results when run multiple times with the same inputs. Maintain version control for all code, configurations, and schema definitions.

#### Observability and Monitoring
Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting across all data systems. Track key metrics including data freshness, quality scores, pipeline performance, and resource utilization.

## 3. Data Storage Architecture

### 3.1 Storage Tiers and Strategy

#### Tier 1: Hot Storage (Operational)
- **Use Case**: Real-time transactions, current month's data, frequently accessed reference data
- **Technology**: High-performance SSDs, in-memory databases (Redis, SAP HANA)
- **Retention**: 0-30 days for transactional data, permanent for critical reference data
- **Access Pattern**: Sub-second response time required
- **Cost Optimization**: Regular monitoring and right-sizing, automated data movement to warm storage

#### Tier 2: Warm Storage (Active Analytics)
- **Use Case**: Recent historical data, active analytics workloads, regulatory reporting
- **Technology**: Cloud object storage with query acceleration (S3 + Athena, Azure Data Lake Gen2)
- **Retention**: 1-24 months depending on data domain
- **Access Pattern**: Query response in seconds to minutes
- **Cost Optimization**: Compression, partitioning, columnar formats (Parquet, ORC)

#### Tier 3: Cold Storage (Archive)
- **Use Case**: Historical data for compliance, long-term trend analysis
- **Technology**: Glacier, Azure Archive Storage, tape libraries for critical backups
- **Retention**: 2-7 years (or as required by regulations)
- **Access Pattern**: Retrieval time in hours to days acceptable
- **Cost Optimization**: Aggressive compression, deduplification, lifecycle policies

### 3.2 Data Format Standards

#### Structured Data
- **Transactional Systems**: Row-based formats for OLTP workloads
- **Analytics Systems**: Columnar formats (Parquet, ORC) for OLAP workloads
- **Standards**: UTF-8 encoding, ISO-8601 for timestamps, consistent null handling

#### Semi-Structured Data
- **Preferred Format**: JSON for APIs, Avro for streaming data
- **Schema Management**: Schema registry for evolution management
- **Validation**: JSON Schema validation at ingestion points

#### Unstructured Data
- **Storage**: Object storage with comprehensive metadata tagging
- **Indexing**: Elasticsearch for searchability, content-based indexing
- **Governance**: Data classification and retention policies

### 3.3 Data Partitioning Strategy

#### Time-Based Partitioning
- Default strategy for time-series data
- Daily partitions for high-volume transactional data
- Monthly/Yearly partitions for historical data
- UTC timezone standardization

#### Functional Partitioning
- Partition by business unit, region, or product line
- Hash partitioning for even distribution
- Composite partitioning for multi-dimensional access patterns

## 4. Data Lakehouse Strategy

### 4.1 Lakehouse Architecture

#### Foundation Layer
- **Storage**: Cloud object storage (S3, ADLS Gen2, GCS)
- **Format**: Delta Lake or Apache Iceberg for ACID transactions
- **Catalog**: Unified metadata catalog (AWS Glue, Unity Catalog)
- **Compute**: Separated compute layer (Spark, Presto, Databricks)

#### Data Zones

**Raw Zone (Bronze Layer)**
- Immutable landing zone for ingested data
- Original format preservation
- Minimal transformations (only for corruption handling)
- Retention based on reprocessing requirements

**Cleaned Zone (Silver Layer)**
- Standardized, validated, and deduplicated data
- Consistent schema enforcement
- Data quality metrics and flags
- Business-ready but not aggregated

**Curated Zone (Gold Layer)**
- Business-aligned data products
- Pre-aggregated metrics and KPIs
- Dimensional models for BI tools
- ML feature stores

### 4.2 Lakehouse Implementation Standards
