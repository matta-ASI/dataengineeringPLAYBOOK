## 2. Data Engineering Principles

### 2.1 Core Principles

#### Principle 1: Data as a Strategic Asset
Data must be treated as a critical organizational asset, with appropriate governance, quality controls, and lifecycle management. Every data engineering decision should consider the long-term value and utility of data across the enterprise.

#### Principle 2: Security and Privacy by Design
All data engineering solutions must implement security controls from inception. This includes encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, data masking for sensitive information, and compliance with banking regulations including PCI-DSS, SOX, and regional privacy laws.

#### Principle 3: Scalability and Elasticity
Systems must be designed to handle exponential growth in data volume, velocity, and variety. Architecture should support both vertical and horizontal scaling, with preference for cloud-native, elastic solutions that can adapt to changing workloads.

#### Principle 4: Data Quality and Integrity
Implement comprehensive data quality frameworks including validation rules, reconciliation processes, and automated quality monitoring. Establish clear data quality metrics and SLAs for critical data domains.

#### Principle 5: Automation First
Prioritize automation in all aspects of data engineering including ingestion, transformation, quality checks, and deployment. Manual processes should be the exception, requiring explicit justification.

#### Principle 6: Self-Service Enablement
Design platforms that enable business users and data scientists to access and analyze data independently while maintaining governance and security controls. Provide intuitive interfaces and comprehensive documentation.

#### Principle 7: Cost Optimization
Continuously monitor and optimize infrastructure costs. Implement tiered storage strategies, data lifecycle management, and resource optimization techniques to balance performance requirements with cost efficiency.

### 2.2 Architectural Principles

#### Loosely Coupled Architecture
Design systems with minimal dependencies between components. Use event-driven architectures and message queues to decouple producers and consumers of data.

#### Idempotency and Reproducibility
All data pipelines must be idempotent - producing the same results when run multiple times with the same inputs. Maintain version control for all code, configurations, and schema definitions.

#### Observability and Monitoring
Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting across all data systems. Track key metrics including data freshness, quality scores, pipeline performance, and resource utilization.

```python
# ADF Pipeline Structure
{
  "name": "SQLServer_to_Snowflake_Daily",
  "activities": [
    {
      "name": "Extract_from_SQLServer",
      "type": "Copy",
      "inputs": ["SQL Server Table"],
      "outputs": ["ADLS Gen2 Staging"],
      "typeProperties": {
        "source": {
          "type": "SqlServerSource",
          "queryTimeout": "02:00:00",

            "partitionUpperBound": "@pipeline().TriggerTime",
            "partitionLowerBound": "@adddays(pipeline().TriggerTime, -1)"
          }
        },
        "sink": {
          "type": "ParquetSink",
          "storeSettings": {
            "type": "AzureBlobFSWriteSettings"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Load_to_Snowflake",
      "type": "Script",
      "dependsOn": ["Extract_from_SQLServer"],
      "typeProperties": {
        "scripts": [
          {
            "type": "Query",
            "text": "COPY INTO raw_db.schema.table FROM @azure_stage PATTERN='*.parquet' FILE_FORMAT=(TYPE=PARQUET) PURGE=TRUE;"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Pattern 2: Near Real-Time CDC Pipeline
```sql
-- SQL Server CDC to Snowflake Streaming
-- 1. SQL Server Side: CDC enabled
-- 2. Azure Function triggers on CDC changes
-- 3. Events sent to Event Hub
-- 4. Snowpipe auto-ingests from Event Hub via Kafka connector

-- Snowflake Stream for CDC processing
CREATE STREAM transactions_stream ON TABLE raw_db.transactions;

-- Task for processing CDC changes
CREATE TASK process_cdc_task
  WAREHOUSE = TRANSFORM_WH
  SCHEDULE = '1 MINUTE'
  WHEN SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA('transactions_stream')
AS
  MERGE INTO analytics_db.fact_transactions t
  USING (
    SELECT * FROM transactions_stream
    WHERE METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT'
  ) s ON t.transaction_id = s.transaction_id
  WHEN MATCHED AND s.METADATA$ACTION = 'DELETE' THEN DELETE
  WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET t.* = s.*
  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (t.*) VALUES (s.*);
```

#### Pattern 3: Power BI Composite Model
```dax
-- DirectQuery to Snowflake for facts
FactTable = 
  SNOWFLAKE.Database("analytics_db").Schema("finance").Table("fact_transactions")

-- Import mode from SQL Server for dimensions
DimCustomer = 
  SQLSERVER.Database("OLTP").Schema("dbo").Table("customers")

-- Relationship definition
RELATIONSHIP(
  FactTable[customer_id],
  DimCustomer[customer_id],
  MANY_TO_ONE
)
```

### 11.2 Performance Tuning Guidelines

#### SQL Server Extraction Optimization
```sql
-- Create optimized extraction view
CREATE VIEW dbo.v_extract_transactions
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
SELECT 
  transaction_id,
  customer_id,
  amount,
  transaction_date,
  -- Include audit columns for incremental loads
  modified_date,
  is_deleted
FROM dbo.transactions WITH (NOLOCK)
WHERE transaction_date >= DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE());

-- Create covering index for extraction
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Extract_Transactions
ON dbo.transactions (transaction_date, modified_date)
INCLUDE (transaction_id, customer_id, amount, is_deleted)
WITH (ONLINE = ON, SORT_IN_TEMPDB = ON);
```

#### Snowflake Query Optimization
```sql
-- Optimize large table joins with clustering
ALTER TABLE analytics_db.fact_transactions
  CLUSTER BY (transaction_date, customer_id);

-- Create materialized view for Power BI
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_daily_summary AS
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('day', transaction_date) as date,
  customer_segment,
  product_category,
  SUM(amount) as total_amount,
  COUNT(*) as transaction_count
FROM analytics_db.fact_transactions t
JOIN analytics_db.dim_customer c ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN analytics_db.dim_product p ON t.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3;
```

#### Azure Data Factory Optimization
```json
{
  "name": "OptimizedCopyActivity",
  "type": "Copy",
  "typeProperties": {
    "source": {
      "type": "SqlServerSource",
      "sqlReaderQuery": "SELECT * FROM dbo.v_extract_transactions WHERE modified_date > '@{activity('LookupWatermark').output.firstRow.WatermarkValue}'",
      "queryTimeout": "02:00:00",
      "isolationLevel": "ReadCommitted"
    },
    "sink": {
      "type": "SnowflakeSink",
      "importSettings": {
        "type": "SnowflakeImportCopyCommand",
        "additionalCopyOptions": {
          "ON_ERROR": "CONTINUE",
          "FORCE": "FALSE",
          "LOAD_UNCERTAIN_FILES": "FALSE"
        }
      }
    },
    "parallelCopies": 16,
    "dataIntegrationUnits": 32,
    "enableSkipIncompatibleRow": true,
    "redirectIncompatibleRowSettings": {
      "linkedServiceName": "AzureBlobStorage",
      "path": "errors"
    }
  }
}
```

### 11.3 Cost Optimization Strategies

#### Snowflake Cost Management
```sql
-- Resource monitors for cost control
CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR monthly_limit
  WITH CREDIT_QUOTA = 1000
  FREQUENCY = MONTHLY
  START_TIMESTAMP = IMMEDIATELY
  TRIGGERS
    ON 75 PERCENT DO NOTIFY
    ON 90 PERCENT DO NOTIFY
    ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND;

-- Assign to warehouses
ALTER WAREHOUSE ANALYTICS_WH SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = monthly_limit;

-- Auto-suspend configuration
ALTER WAREHOUSE ANALYTICS_WH SET
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 300  -- 5 minutes
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1
  MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 3
  SCALING_POLICY = 'ECONOMY';  -- Favor cost over performance
```

#### Azure Cost Optimization
```powershell
# PowerShell script for Azure cost optimization
# Schedule SQL Server VMs to shut down during non-business hours
$automationAccount = "BankingAutomation"
$resourceGroup = "Banking-RG"

# Create automation runbook
New-AzAutomationRunbook `
  -Name "StopSQLVMs" `
  -Type PowerShell `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -AutomationAccountName $automationAccount

# Schedule for 8 PM daily
New-AzAutomationSchedule `
  -Name "EveningShutdown" `
  -StartTime "20:00:00" `
  -DayInterval 1 `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -AutomationAccountName $automationAccount
```

### 11.4 Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

#### Multi-Region Setup
```yaml
# Azure Traffic Manager Configuration
Primary Region: East US 2
  - SQL Server AG Primary
  - ADF Primary Instance
  - Snowflake Primary Account

Secondary Region: West US 2
  - SQL Server AG Secondary (Async)
  - ADF Secondary Instance (Cold standby)
  - Snowflake Secondary Account (Data Sharing)

Failover Strategy:
  - RPO: 15 minutes for OLTP, 1 hour for Analytics
  - RTO: 1 hour for OLTP, 4 hours for Analytics
  - Automated failover for SQL Server AG
  - Manual failover for Snowflake with account redirect
```

#### Backup and Recovery Procedures
```sql
-- Snowflake Time Travel recovery
-- Recover accidentally dropped table
UNDROP TABLE analytics_db.fact_transactions;

-- Restore table to specific point in time
CREATE TABLE fact_transactions_recovered
  CLONE analytics_db.fact_transactions
  AT(TIMESTAMP => '2025-09-08 12:00:00'::TIMESTAMP);

-- SQL Server backup to Azure
BACKUP DATABASE [BankingOLTP] 
TO URL = 'https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/backups/BankingOLTP_20250909.bak'
WITH COMPRESSION, ENCRYPTION, STATS = 10;
